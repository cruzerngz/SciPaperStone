# SciPaperStone
My first python program!

###How to play:
This game requires you to install the python shell on your computer.
Upon opening the py file, you can choose the total number of games to play. The program will tally up the scores at the end of the game.

####Entering your move
Moves can be entered in full, such as `scissors`, or `sci`, or even `ors`. Alternatively, entering the index corresponding to the position of the move in the list will also register. *Note that the index starts from 1*.
In the event that you have entered an invalid move, such as `scsiors`, the game will print an random insult from a predefined list. You have a total of 5 tries per round to spell the move correctly, after which the game will exit.

####Ending the game early
You can end the game any time by entering `finish` or `stop`. After which the current winner will be named.

Thanks for playing!
